    "text": "Even if Ultraviolet offered me their EV bike for free with a bow on top, lifetime charging, service and upgrades...I still wouldn’t take it. Sell it to someone who likes tech toys. I ride machines not experiments.\nLet’s get brutally honest here..EV bikes like Ultraviolet are flashy, over glorified gadgets. They look good on paper and Instagram reels but in real world Indian conditions? They're a joke! Our roads, weather, dust and distances don’t care about your digital dashboard or futuristic LED lights 🤷🏼‍♂️\n\nMy 11 year old Royal Enfield Classic 500 which they don’t even make anymore...still dominates rough terrains like Ladakh, Himachal, Nepal and the Northeast without skipping a beat. It doesn’t need an update. It doesn’t panic if there’s no charger nearby. It doesn’t beg for software support or battery calibration. It just rides and roars. Every damn time 👍🍺 These EVs? They're built for urban coffee shop crawls and weekend flexing not for people who actually live and breathe adventure. Battery anxiety is real. Charging stations are still inconsistent. And once your battery degrades and it will in 2–4 years in India’s heat. You’re left with a useless, overpriced e-brick. And good luck finding a mechanic for that in the middle of nowhere 😂\nYou can cover the whole of India with charging stations and I still won’t trade a real engine for a silent spin. Torque, reliability, control and soul that’s what makes a bike a machine. Not circuits and Bluetooth. So no I don’t want Ultraviolet, even for free 🤷🏼‍♂️ I want a bike that bleeds character, not a plastic spaceship with a progress bar 👍",

For example our family car is an almost 15 yo Swift. No tech on it at all. Not even a radio. I’ve had opportunities to upgrade but I never did because it is so engaging to drive. Low power but loads of feedback, crisp gearbox. Every good clutch engagement is a win. I don’t even mind Bangalore traffic because this car makes it a test of skills that I have been honing for 20 years. I have no doubt that this bike is amazing and I am glad that you are enjoying it but I hope you get where I am coming from. Sorry for the long ass comment. I hope you will indulge my whining just this once",

I think now ultraviolet is only available in main cities. And this removable battery package is useful for uncomfortable parking areas.And comparatively Revolt battery pack is small. So it would be easier to handle if the battery pack that comes with the Mach 2 in UV comes in two parts and the Recon battery pack comes in three parts.",
