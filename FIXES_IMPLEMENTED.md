# ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed - Analysis & Frontend Improvements

## **Issue 1: Comment Analysis Limit Fixed** âœ…

**Problem:** System was only analyzing ~50 comments per query, which is insufficient for comprehensive analysis.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Increased analysis limit from 50 to 1000 comments per query** (20x improvement)
- Updated `_extract_relevant_youtube_comments()` method in `services/enhanced_agent_service.py`
- Enhanced summary statistics to show "Total comments analyzed: X (from pool of Y relevant comments)"
- Added transparency about analysis method and dataset size

**Technical Changes:**
```python
# Before: max_comments: int = 50
# After: max_comments: int = 1000
async def _extract_relevant_youtube_comments(self, query: str, youtube_data: Dict[str, List[Dict]], max_comments: int = 1000) -> str:
```

**Impact:**
- Queries now analyze up to 1000 most relevant comments instead of 50
- More comprehensive sentiment analysis and trend detection
- Better statistical significance for conclusions
- Maintains relevance ranking while increasing analytical depth

## **Issue 2: Frontend Data Description Updated** âœ…

**Problem:** Frontend claimed "10,000+ authentic customer voices" but actual dataset contains 46,367 comments.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Updated tagline to reflect larger dataset: "40,000+ authentic customer voices"**
- Maintains conservative estimate while being more accurate
- Updated in `streamlit_app_premium.py`

**Technical Changes:**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<p class="tagline">Real-time insights from 10,000+ authentic customer voices</p>

<!-- After -->
<p class="tagline">Real-time insights from 40,000+ authentic customer voices</p>
```

**Impact:**
- More accurate representation of dataset size
- Better user expectations about data comprehensiveness
- Maintains professional presentation while being truthful

## **Issue 3: Professional Source Citations (Gemini Deep Research Style)** âœ…

**Problem:** Source citations were informal and inconsistent, not matching professional research standards.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Complete overhaul of source citation system in Gemini prompts**
- Implemented footnote-style references [^1], [^2], [^3], [^4]
- Added professional "References" section at end of responses
- Enhanced source attribution for different data types

**Technical Changes:**
```python
# Professional Source Citations Format:
- YouTube user feedback: [^1] = "YouTube Community Analysis - [OEM_Name] User Comments"
- Market data: [^2] = "Industry Report - [Source_Domain] Market Intelligence"
- Technical reviews: [^3] = "Expert Review - [Source_Title] Technical Analysis"
- News articles: [^4] = "News Report - [Publication] Market Update"

# End-of-response References section:
**References:**
[^1] YouTube Community Analysis - [OEM] User Comments. Real customer feedback analysis from verified YouTube data.
[^2] Industry Report - [Domain]. Market intelligence and industry trends.
[^3] Expert Review - [Title]. Professional technical analysis and evaluation.
[^4] News Report - [Publication]. Recent market developments and updates.
```

**Impact:**
- Professional-grade source attribution matching academic standards
- Clear distinction between different types of data sources
- Enhanced credibility and transparency
- Better user trust in analysis quality
