Every damn time üëçüç∫ These EVs? They're built for urban coffee shop crawls and weekend flexing not for people who actually live and breathe adventure. Battery anxiety is real.

For example our family car is an almost 15 yo Swift. No tech on it at all. Not even a radio. I‚Äôve had opportunities to upgrade but I never did because it is so engaging to drive. Low power but loads of feedback, crisp gearbox. Every good clutch engagement is a win. I don‚Äôt even mind Bangalore traffic because this car makes it a test of skills that I have been honing for 20 years. I have no doubt that this bike is amazing and I am glad that you are enjoying it but I hope you get where I am coming from. Sorry for the long ass comment. I hope you will indulge my whining just this once",
