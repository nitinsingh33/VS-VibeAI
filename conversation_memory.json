      "query": "Why is bajaj still able to sell if it has so much negative sentiment?",
      "response": "Excellent query. This is a classic market paradox that highlights the complex interplay between online sentiment and real-world sales performance, especially involving legacy brands in a nascent market like Indian EVs.\n\nMy analysis indicates that while Bajaj Chetak faces significant and severe negative user feedback online, particularly concerning service and battery reliability, its ability to maintain sales is a direct result of powerful brand legacy, a vast physical sales network, and a product strategy that appeals to a more traditional, risk-averse consumer segment.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of my analysis:\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nBajaj's continued sales success, despite a high volume of negative online sentiment, is not an anomaly but a function of several overriding factors:\n\n1.  **Contextual Sentiment:** While Bajaj's negative sentiment is high at **15.6%**, it is not an outlier. It is comparable to market leader Ola Electric (**16.2%**) and notably lower than its primary legacy competitor, TVS iQube (**20.2%**). The entire EV market is currently fraught with post-purchase issues, leveling the playing field of complaints [^1].\n2.  **Overpowering Brand Legacy:** The \"Bajaj\" and \"Chetak\" names command immense trust and nostalgia, particularly among older demographics and in Tier-2/3 cities. This historical brand equity creates a powerful buffer against negative online reviews [^1].\n3.  **Vast Physical Network:** Unlike newer digital-first brands, Bajaj's extensive, pre-existing dealership and service network offers a tangible sense of security to buyers, even if the quality of service at these centers is frequently criticized [^1].\n4.  **Targeted Product Strategy:** The Chetak's metal body, simple interface, and retro design appeal to a \"family scooter\" segment that prioritizes durability and familiarity over the high-tech, performance-oriented approach of brands like Ather or Ola [^1].\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n#### 1. The Reality of Negative Sentiment in the EV Market\n\nThe premise that Bajaj is unique in its negative sentiment is not supported by the data. An analysis of over 4,600 relevant user comments for Bajaj reveals a negative sentiment rate of **15.6%**. While significant, this must be viewed in the context of the broader market [^1].\n\n| OEM | Negative Sentiment % (of total comments) | Analysis |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **TVS iQube** | 20.2% | Highest among top competitors, indicating widespread service/product issues. |\n| **Ola Electric** | 16.2% | High volume of complaints, often related to service and software. |\n| **Bajaj Chetak** | **15.6%** | High, but not the market's worst. Complaints are severe and concentrated. |\n| **Hero Vida** | 14.8% | Similar level of issues as other legacy brands. |\n| **Revolt** | 14.2% | Moderate-to-high negative sentiment, primarily service-related. |\n| **Ather Energy** | 11.9% | Lower than legacy brands, but still facing service quality challenges. |\n\n*Source: YouTube Community Analysis - August 2025 OEM Comment Data* [^1]\n\n**Conclusion:** The data shows that after-sales issues are a sector-wide problem. For a potential buyer, every major brand presents a risk of poor service. In this environment, Bajaj's issues do not stand out as uniquely prohibitive, leading many to default to the brand they know best.\n\n#### 2. Key Drivers of Negative Sentiment for Bajaj Chetak\n\nWhile the *quantity* of negative sentiment isn't an outlier, the *quality* and severity of the complaints are alarming. Thematic analysis of user feedback reveals two critical failure points [^1]:\n\n*   **Critical Battery & Component Failures:** Users report catastrophic issues that render the scooter unusable.\n    *   One user reported a drastic range drop from 120 km to just 32 km after three months, with the service center confirming a faulty battery requiring a month-long replacement [^1].\n    *   Another user's battery died completely within a year, which they claim cost them their job due to the scooter's unreliability [^1].\n    *   Multiple comments mention the scooter stopping abruptly mid-ride, main battery cells failing after just 1,800 km, and seeing \"multiple Chetak scooters parked at the service centre with the exact same issue\" [^1].\n\n*   **Systemic After-Sales Service Failures:** This is the most dominant theme. The feedback describes the service experience not just as poor, but as mentally exhausting and disrespectful.\n    *   Users describe service staff as \"rude, non-cooperative,\" and service centers as \"completely useless\" [^1].\n    *   A user from Nagpur detailed being treated with neglect and arrogance, calling the purchase a source of \"mental stress\" and \"mental harassment\" [^1].\n    *   A recurring complaint is the long waiting period for spare parts, with users reporting waits of \"20 days,\" \"one month,\" or even longer for critical components like batteries [^1].\n\n#### 3. Factors Sustaining Bajaj's Sales\n\nDespite these severe issues, four key pillars support Bajaj Chetak's market performance.\n\n**1. The Power of Brand Legacy & Trust (\"Hamara Bajaj\")**\nFor decades, Bajaj has been a cornerstone of Indian mobility. The \"Chetak\" name itself is iconic, associated with durability and family values. This deep-seated brand trust, built over generations, is a powerful intangible asset. For many buyers, particularly in the 40+ age demographic and in non-metro areas, this legacy outweighs negative reviews from anonymous online users. One user explicitly stated they purchased the Chetak because their \"father used to own a Bajaj Priya and he misses having an all-metal body 2 wheeler\" [^1].\n\n**2. The \"Brick-and-Mortar\" Advantage: Physical Network**\nBajaj's vast, pre-existing network of showrooms and service centers provides a significant psychological advantage. In a market where new, digital-first brands have limited physical presence, the ability for a customer to walk into a local dealership they have known for years creates a sense of security and accountability. Even if the service quality is poor, the physical existence of a service center is a crucial factor in the purchase decision for many who are wary of app-based service models.\n\n**3. Product-Market Fit with a Traditional Segment**\nThe Chetak is strategically positioned as a premium, family-oriented scooter, not a tech-forward performance machine.\n*   **Metal Body:** This is a key differentiator. In a market dominated by fiber bodies, the Chetak's metal construction is perceived as more durable and safe, appealing to a traditional mindset. One user noted, \"Body weight is not",

      "query": "Show me sentiment for all OEMs in last 10 months",
      "response": "Of course. Here is a comprehensive sentiment analysis for all major electric two-wheeler OEMs in the Indian market over the last 10 months, based on the latest available data.\n\n### **Executive Summary: EV Market Sentiment (Last 10 Months)**\n\nOverall consumer sentiment in the Indian electric two-wheeler market is predominantly negative, driven by persistent issues with after-sales service, battery performance, and discrepancies between claimed and real-world range [^1].

In contrast, legacy brands and high-volume players like **TVS, Ola, and Bajaj** face the highest proportion of negative feedback, primarily centered on service and reliability concerns [^1].\n\nHere is the sentiment ranking based on the Net Sentiment Score (Positive % - Negative %) for each OEM over the past 10 months.\n\n| Rank | OEM | Positive Sentiment | Negative Sentiment | Net Sentiment Score | Key Sentiment Drivers [^1] |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| ðŸ¥‡ | **Ultraviolette** | 15.7% | 9.8% | **+5.9%** | **Positive**: Performance, Design. **Negative**: High service costs. |\n| ðŸ¥ˆ | **Ather Energy** | 12.7% | 11.5% | **+1.2%** | **Positive**: Build quality, Reliability. **Negative**: High cost, Pro Pack fees. |\n| ðŸ¥‰ | **Revolt** | 12.6% | 13.9% | **-1.3%** | **Positive**: Unique e-motorcycle. **Negative**: Service delays, Battery issues. |\n| 4 | **River Mobility** | 8.7% | 11.1% | **-2.4%** | **Positive**: Practicality, Storage. **Negative**: Limited availability, Build quality. |\n| 5 | **BGauss** | 6.9% | 10.7% | **-3.8%** | **Positive**: Simple design. **Negative**: Mixed service feedback. |\n| 6 | **Ampere** | 8.3% | 13.2% | **-4.9%** | **Positive**: Value proposition. **Negative**: Range discrepancy, Quality issues. |\n| 7 | **Hero Vida** | 6.2% | 13.9% | **-7.7%** | **Positive**: Removable battery. **Negative**: Limp mode, Service issues. |\n| 8 | **Bajaj Chetak** | 6.8% | 15.9% | **-9.1%** | **Positive**: Brand trust, Metal body. **Negative**: Severe battery failures, Service delays. |\n| 9 | **Ola Electric** | 5.5% | 15.9% | **-10.4%** | **Positive**: Features, Performance. **Negative**: Widespread service issues, Software bugs. |\n| 10 | **TVS iQube** | 7.6% | 22.1% | **-14.5%** | **Positive**: Reliability (older models). **Negative**: Severe service issues, Technical faults. |\n\n***Source**: Analysis of 37,700+ user comments over the last 10 months* [^1]\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed OEM Sentiment Analysis**\n\nThis analysis is derived from a comprehensive dataset of over 37,700 relevant user comments. The sentiment distribution for each OEM is as follows [^1]:\n\n*   **1. Ultraviolette**: Positive: **15.7%**, Negative: **9.8%**, Neutral: 74.5%\n    *   **Insight**: Leads the market with the highest positive sentiment. Enthusiasm is driven by its unique design and performance. However, negative comments consistently highlight very high servicing costs, with one user stating, \"In Servicing of the bike, they will loot you...whatever you are putting for petrol, you are giving it for servicing\" [^1].\n\n*   **2. Ather Energy**: Positive: **12.7%**, Negative: **11.5%**, Neutral: 75.8%\n    *   **Insight**: Maintains a strong positive-to-negative ratio. Users frequently praise its premium build quality and reliability. Negative sentiment is primarily linked to the high upfront cost and the mandatory \"Pro Pack\" subscription for essential features.\n\n*   **3. Revolt**: Positive: **12.6%**, Negative: **13.9%**, Neutral: 73.5%\n    *   **Insight**: Holds a unique position as an electric motorcycle, which garners positive interest. However, it suffers from significant negative feedback regarding after-sales service, with users reporting extreme delays. One user noted waiting \"FIVE MONTHS for repairs\" for a battery issue [^1].\n\n*   **4. River Mobility**: Positive: **8.7%**, Negative: **11.1%**, Neutral: 80.2%\n    *   **Insight**: Receives praise for its practical \"SUV of scooters\" design and large storage capacity. Negative sentiment is focused on its limited city presence and concerns about build quality, particularly the plastics used.\n\n*   **5. BGauss**: Positive: **6.9%**, Negative: **10.7%**, Neutral: 82.4%\n    *   **Insight**: Generally perceived as a straightforward, no-frills option.

Ampere**: Positive: **8.3%**, Negative: **13.2%**, Neutral: 78.5%\n    *   **Insight**: Attracts customers with its value-for-money models. However, detailed negative feedback points to significant gaps between claimed and actual range (70-75 km vs. 136 km claimed), lack of promised features, and poor accessory availability [^1].\n\n*   **7. Hero Vida**: Positive: **6.2%**, Negative: **13.9%**, Neutral: 80.0%\n    *   **Insight**: The removable battery feature is a key driver of positive sentiment. However, the brand is heavily criticized for technical issues like the vehicle entering \"limp mode\" and inconsistent service quality.\n\n*   **8. Bajaj Chetak**: Positive: **6.8%**, Negative: **15.9%**, Neutral: 77.3%\n    *   **Insight**: As highlighted in our previous conversation, Bajaj's legacy brand name and metal body design attract positive comments. However, it faces a high volume of severe negative feedback. Users report catastrophic battery failures within months of purchase, with one customer noting a range drop from 120 km to just 32 km and a one-month wait for a replacement battery [^1]. This aligns with the market paradox of sales persisting despite poor user experiences online.\n\n*   **9. Ola Electric**: Positive: **5.5%**, Negative: **15.9%**, Neutral: 78.6%\n    *   **Insight**: While its products are praised for features and performance, Ola is overwhelmed by negative sentiment regarding its after-sales service. Common complaints include extremely long wait times, unresolved issues, and poor communication. Users also express frustration with software updates that lock previously free features behind a paywall [^1].\n\n*   **10. TVS iQube**: Positive: **7.6%**, Negative: **22.1%**, Neutral: 70.3%\n    *   **Insight**: TVS has the highest negative sentiment percentage in the market. While some users praise its reliability and comfortable ride, a significant volume of detailed complaints points to severe technical faults, such as motor failures and software glitches that render the scooter unusable for months. One user reported their scooter was at the service center for three months with an unknown issue [^1].\n\n### **Analyst Conclusion**\n\nThe data from the last 10 months paints a clear picture of a market in transition [^1]. While EV adoption is growing, the customer experience, particularly after-sales service and product reliability, remains the primary challenge for almost all OEMs.\n\n*   **Performance vs. Practicality**: Niche, performance-oriented brands like **Ultraviolette** are winning the sentiment battle among enthusiasts, while practical and reliable brands like **Ather** appeal to discerning urban commuters.\n*   **The Service Crisis**: High-volume players like **Ola, TVS, and Bajaj** are struggling significantly with the scale of their service operations. The volume of negative comments directly correlates with their market share, indicating that their service infrastructure has not kept pace with sales growth.\n*   **The Legacy Paradox**: Brands like **Bajaj** continue to leverage their legacy and distribution network to maintain sales, even as online sentiment highlights critical product flaws. This gap between online perception and sales figures is a key characteristic of the current market phase.\n\nMoving forward, the OEMs that can successfully address the fundamental issues of **service quality, battery reliability, and transparent communication** will be best positioned to build long-term brand loyalty and lead the market.\n\n---\n**References:**\n[^1] Social Media Intelligence.
