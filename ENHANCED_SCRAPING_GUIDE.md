## ⚡ Performance Tips

### **Optimize Scraping Speed**
1. **Stable Internet**: Ensure good connection for faster downloads
2. **Run Overnight**: For large volumes, run during off-peak hours
3. **Target Adjustment**: Lower target if time-constrained
4. **Specific OEMs**: Focus on 1-2 OEMs for faster completion

### **Handle Interruptions**
```bash
# If interrupted, data is auto-saved
# Resume by loading existing data:
python -c "
from services.enhanced_agent_service import EnhancedAgentService
agent = EnhancedAgentService()
import asyncio
data = asyncio.run(agent.load_youtube_data(force_refresh=True))
print(f'Loaded {sum(len(c) for c in data.values())} comments')
"
```

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Check File Sizes**: Should be several MB per OEM
- **Verify Counts**: Aim for 80%+ of target per OEM  
- **Spot Check**: Review sample comments for relevance
- **Date Range**: Ensure recent comments (2024-2025)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**1. "ModuleNotFoundError" for youtube packages**
```bash
pip install youtube-comment-downloader yt-dlp
```

**2. "Low comment count" for some OEMs**
- ✅ Some OEMs have fewer YouTube discussions
- ✅ System automatically adjusts search strategies
- ✅ 300+ comments per OEM is still excellent data

**3. "Scraping takes too long"**
- ✅ Run during off-peak hours
- ✅ Reduce target (e.g., 300 instead of 500)
- ✅ Use specific OEM scraping for priority brands

**4. "YouTube API limits"**
- ✅ Built-in rate limiting prevents blocks
- ✅ Automatic retries with delays
- ✅ Graceful degradation to available data

### **Verification Commands**
```bash
# Check if scraping completed successfully
ls -la *comments*.json

# Count total comments in latest file
python -c "
import json
with open('$(ls all_oem_comments_*_total_*.json | tail -1)', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(f'Total comments: {data[\"total_comments\"]}')
    for oem, count in data['oem_summary'].items():
        print(f'{oem}: {count} comments')
"
```
