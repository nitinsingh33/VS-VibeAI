We loved our cabin and thought ALL the food was excellent.\nWhen we do our next one it will probably be with them again because we have found with ocean going cruises that although we may like one ship over another, we definitely prefer one line after sampling multiple ones and so I doubt we will try to find a \"better\" one when we already like one.",

I did not expect everyone to be apart of a tour group.  There were 5 Germans and 3 Americans (including me) that booked direct with them.  Once I realized that pretty much be solo the whole time, I had a great time.  Most of my tours I was the only american so felt like a VIP and impressed they still did the excursions with so few people.  I have looked at all the river cruises and Amadeus is the best deal for a solo traveler.  Also the cost for adding their excursions is low as well.  I definitely recommend to try them.  They also have a rewards club so easy to get aboard credit and other perks with it.  I just booked a tour again that is charting an Amadeus ship.",

    "text": "We have done two river cruises, one on Uniworld and one on Tauck. We do have three river cruises booked in 2026, all on Tauck. What we like about Tauck is their exceptional service and \"all inclusive\" pricing. Your Tauck tour starts at the airport where they pick you up and provide transportation to the hotel. All excursions are included... no extra costs for more exclusive excursions. Their tour directors are exceptional. Fellow travelers seem to be like minded people who have traveled a lot. I am sure that Viking would be great, and we have been on several Viking ocean cruises. I have marked off Scenic. We had a cruise cancelled during Covid, and they kept $500 saying the deposit was non-refundable. While our Uniworld river cruise was enjoyable, their ships are a little on the gaudy side. You mentioned that the Tauck ships are configured for 130 passengers compared to 150 on most other river ship which is a plus for Tauck. Tauck always seems to offer something \"extra\" on their tours. If you are a repeat Tauck traveler, they also offer a complimentary pre or post hotel stay for bookings more than a year in advance. I would say that the big difference between Tauck and Viking is that Tauck is more \"all inclusive\" while Viking is \"ala cart\". Based on reviews I have read and feedback from friends, I think Tauck, Viking, AmaWaterways, and Avalon would all offer a great river cruise experience for a U.S. traveler.",

Sometimes their responses to requests, came across as very rude, and often offhand. \nThe food was buffet, and very heavy. Some interpretations of non-German food, such as Paella, were inedible.

    "text": "We took a Rhine River cruise w Viking in 2008. It was terrific. The stops were all the right places. Typically, the guided tours were relatively brief and informative and provided us counseling on walk-abouts on our own. One exception - which was fine - was Heidelberg. The port was Manheim - thirty minutes by bus away from the old town. Food was very good. Crew/staff were simply there to do their jobs - not entertain. Fast forward to 2022 we booked the Rhine Cruise w Viking with Christmas Markets. The route had been altered. In 2008, Colgne was the first stop. In 2022, Dusseldorf had been added. God knows why. (The Christmas Market was late opening and our departure soon. Everything else was closed.) Cologne was later that evening much after the cathedral had closed. Essentially, the line seemed determined to conduct their normal Rhine cruise with Christmas Markets shoe-horned in where possible. The tours were longer, outside in very cold weather. We had to go on the tours to get to the markets. Again, those Christmas Markets appeared to be an afterthought. We supposed Viking was obligated to tour contracts. We'd experienced Christmas Markets in Freiberg, Kaysersberg, Colmar, Budapest and others. The Markets on this cruise deserved better. They should have been the highlight. The crew/staff were ever present in the evenings, always selling - themselves, primarily. One night, a cello/guitar duo was brought on board to entertain. These ladies were terrific. The real spoiler was the last evening briefing on how best to complete the surveys - how to best improve crew/staff chances of advancement. This cruise was not quite Carnival. But, it wasn't the quiet, under-stated Viking we loved in 2008. Obviously, I don't rate Viking particularly well these days.",

    "text": "We just took a Viking cruise. Prior experience was 2 cruises on Ama Waterways. Viking sets their expectations very high in their U.S. advertising and marketing programs. We found them no better than AMA overall, and their shore excursions were not quite as good. We paid Viking for an optional winery tour that went to a very small French location that had wines I would rate no better than we can buy here in Indiana. The ship we were on was not squeaky clean either. Food was good, but again no better than Ama. However, I have to admit that at 3, our sample size of European river cruises is very small. In summary, we were pleased we did the trip, but far from overwhelmed by this Viking experience. It was a case of very high expectations that were not met.",

I understand that you need catchy titles for your videos to generate clicks and hence income, but the title for this video is clearly beyond acceptable. First of all, you have not even been on some of these lines, but still feel that some frustrated souls on CruiseCritic provide 100% accurate information so you can tell others \"to stay clear\" of these lines? As others have rightly said, a cruise line that clearly primarily caters for a specific (non-English) language group should not be assessed by people who refuse to acknowledge that difference (or learn a foreign language). Also, a budget line cannot be ranked together with a luxury line - if the price per day is triple or more, it would be appalling to see the budget line ahead, and only that might be a reason to \"stay clear\" of that luxury line, but only if confirmed by own experience.",

When we were off ship over lunch, Tauck gave us cash to cover our lunch and even money to buy ornaments during Christmas market tours.  I‚Äôll take smaller ships, even smaller excursion groups to exclusive locations anytime.  Take the cruise before you post reviews based on poor deduction from people‚Äôs post cruise comments.",
